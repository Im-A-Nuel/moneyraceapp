# Problem and Solution

## ❌ The Problem

### 0. People Prefer Saving Over High-Risk Investing (Global Reality)

> **Globally, the majority of people prefer saving and low-risk financial instruments over high-risk investments.**

Multiple international studies show that:
- Most households prioritize **liquidity, safety, and predictability** over high returns
- Savings accounts and cash remain the **most widely used financial tools worldwide**
- High-risk assets (stocks speculation, crypto trading) are avoided by the majority of the population

However, traditional savings:
- Produce **near-zero real returns**
- Lose value to inflation
- Do not reward long-term consistency

**This creates a massive gap:**  
People want to save safely — but their money is not working for them.

Money Race is built exactly for this gap.

---

### 1. Lack of Savings Discipline

> **~70% of people struggle to maintain consistent savings habits.**

Traditional savings methods offer:
- No accountability
- No motivation
- No consequences for missing deposits  

People start with good intentions but quickly lose momentum.

---

### 2. No Social Support

Saving money is typically a **solitary activity**.

Without:
- Peer accountability
- Shared goals
- Social pressure  

People quit silently.

---

### 3. Boring Experience

Traditional savings products are:
- Passive
- Static
- Emotionless  

No progress feedback, no excitement, no sense of achievement.

---

### 4. Information Overload & Risk Aversion

Despite thousands of investment options:
- Most users **do not want to actively trade**
- Many suffer from **analysis paralysis**
- Risk tolerance is often **overestimated by DeFi products**

Result:
Users either do nothing — or take risks they don't fully understand.

---

### 5. Trust Issues in DeFi

Many DeFi savings protocols are:
- Too complex for beginners
- Hard to explain to non-crypto users
- Lacking social proof
- Exposed to smart contract risk without guardrails

This creates fear, not confidence.

## ✅ Our Solution

### Money Race: Gamified Group Savings

Money Race is **not a high-risk investment product**.  
It is a **savings-first protocol with yield as a bonus**, not the core promise.

| Problem | Our Solution |
|--------|--------------|
| Preference for safety | **Savings-first design** |
| Lack of discipline | **Gamified weekly commitments** |
| No social support | **Group savings rooms** |
| Boring experience | **Racing mechanics & leaderboards** |
| Information overload | **AI strategy abstraction** |
| Trust issues | **Transparent smart contracts on Sui** |

## How We Solve It

### 🎯 Proportional Rewards (No Principal Risk)

When you join a room, you commit to regular deposits.

Your yield share is **proportional to consistency**, not speculation:
- Deposit 5 / 5 weeks → 100% of your yield share
- Deposit 3 / 5 weeks → 60% of your yield share

**Important:**  
- Your principal is never slashed  
- Missed deposits only reduce yield, not capital  

This aligns with real-world saver psychology.

### 👥 Group Savings Advantage

**Saving together is mathematically superior to saving alone.**

**Example:** Alice saves 500 USDC over 5 weeks.

| Scenario | Vault Size | Total Yield | Alice Gets | Profit |
|--------|-----------|-------------|------------|--------|
| Solo | 500 USDC | 4.2 USDC | 4.2 USDC | +0.84% |
| With Friends | 1100 USDC | 10 USDC | 4.5 USDC | **+0.91%** ✅ |

**Why this works**
- Larger vaults access better DeFi yields
- Yield scales faster than individual deposits
- Social discipline increases consistency

You earn **more**, with **less stress**.
